Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities at which a computing hobbyist might engage. A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active developers. 
In some cases, hobby development is in support of a "homebrew" computing device, for example, a simple solo-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor. Or, development can be for architecture already in widespread use. Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts and texts, or may commence by designing an existing operating system. In either case, the hobbyist is his/her own developer, or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests.
Examples of a hobby operating system include Syllable and TempleOS.

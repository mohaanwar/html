Operating system (OS) is a system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and supports common services for computer programs. Early computers were designed to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that can automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing. Until the early 1960s, Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms.[9] Hardware features that were added enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts, and parallel processing. Operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers, when personal computers became common in the 1980s.
